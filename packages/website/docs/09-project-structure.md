# Project Structure

High-level guidance on how to lay out Effect projects. Where services, schemas, config, and entrypoints live, and how to keep dependencies flowing in the right direction.

## TODO

- Document recommended folder structure for Effect projects
- Show where to place services, schemas, config, errors
- Monorepo vs single package organization
- Module boundaries and dependency direction
- Example structures for:
  - CLI apps
  - HTTP APIs
  - Libraries
  - Full-stack apps
